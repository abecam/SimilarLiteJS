# SimilarLiteJS
Pur Javascript same game

I used ChatGPT to create an initial draft, that does not really work but was useful to get a base including how to show the board (that didn't change much), and fixed/completed it to the latest version. It is still WIP, saved scores by position and # of colours will come probably next, then some more enhancement so it's easier to understand what is happening (so the UI).
